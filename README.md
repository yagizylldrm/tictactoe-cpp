# 🕹️ C++ Terminal Tic-Tac-Toe

A colorized, Object-Oriented Tic-Tac-Toe game designed for the Linux (and maybe Windows) terminal.

## ✨ Features

- **OOP Design:** Encapsulated game logic within a `TicTacToe` class.
- **Visuals:** ANSI escape codes for colored markers and a custom ASCII art title screen.
- **Build System:** Includes a `Makefile` for easy compilation.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

Since this was developed on Arch Linux, it is optimized for `g++`.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yagizylldrm/tictactoe-cpp.git
